This repository contains the VIMMJIPDA target tracker and the interface for running the colav_simulator with the VIMMJIPDA
The VIMMJIPDA (Visibility Interacting Multiple Models Integrated Probabilistic Data Association) target tracker was presented by Hem, Brekke and Tokle in the article "_Multitarget Tracking With Multiple Models and Visibility: Derivation and Verification on Maritime Radar Data_"
The source code for the VIMMJIPDA is open-source and available [here:]([url](https://codeocean.com/capsule/3448343/tree/v1))
The interface for running the VIMMJIPDA in the colav_simulator was created by Ragnar Norbye Wien during the work on his Master's thesis
